# OptoPrimDB

OptoPrimDB is an early-stage, experimental database of published optogenetics
studies in primates.

This repository contains a static, client-side prototype that allows browsing,
searching, filtering, and sorting paper-level metadata using a JSON dataset.

⚠️ This is a very early testing version:
- the dataset is incomplete
- the schema may evolve
- the UI is subject to change
